# Venom Operator Manual

Welcome to the Operator Manual. This document explains how to use the Venom system daily, understand the displayed metrics, and manage its resources. Unlike technical documentation, we focus here on *usability*, not *implementation*.

## 1. Key Concepts

To effectively collaborate with Venom, it is worth understanding two foundations of its operation: **Timelines** and **Dreams**.

### ⏳ Timelines
Think of Timelines as **save points in a game** or **alternative versions of reality**.

*   **What is it for?** Venom allows you to experiment safely. Before making risky changes to the code, the system (or you manually) creates a "snapshot" of the current state.
*   **How does it work for you?** If an experiment fails, you can immediately revert to the starting point without losing a working system.
*   **User/Core Timelines**: These are your "main" saves – backups before refactoring, project checkpoints. They are valuable and you usually want to keep them.
*   **Usage Example**: You plan a major refactoring of the navigation. You create a Timeline named "before-refactor-nav". If the code stops compiling halfway through, you restore the "before-refactor-nav" state with one click.

### 🌙 Dreams
Dreams are Venom's **self-improvement** process during downtime.

*   **What is it?** When you are not using the system (or at night), Venom analyzes its knowledge base and comes up with hypothetical programming problems, then tries to solve them.
*   **Why?** Every solved "dream" becomes a new skill (lesson) that Venom can use in the future to help you.
*   **Dream Timelines**: Every dream takes place in an isolated timeline so as not to clutter your main project. This data can take up a lot of space but is fully reproducible (can be safely deleted).
*   **Example**: Venom noticed yesterday that you had a problem with Nginx configuration. At night, it "dreamt" a scenario of fixing the `nginx.conf` file, tested it in isolation, and now "knows" how to do it correctly when you ask about it tomorrow.

## 2. Configuration Panel: Disk Costs

In the `/config` section, you will find the **"Disk Costs"** panel. It is used to monitor the health of your working environment.

### How to read the metrics?

The panel divides data into several categories. Here are the most important ones you can ask about:

#### 🟣 Data: dreaming (timelines)
*   **What is it?**: Space occupied on the disk by **Dreams** (historical training simulations).
*   **Can I delete it?**: **YES**. This is "historical" data. Deleting it will not break the project; you will only lose the ability to see "how Venom solved that specific dream" (but the knowledge/lesson learned from it is already saved in memory and will remain safe).
*   **Recommendation**: If you are running out of disk space, this is the first candidate for cleaning.

#### 🔵 Data: timelines (user/core)
*   **What is it?**: Space occupied by **your** restore points and project backups.
*   **Can I delete it?**: **CAREFULLY**. Deleting this data means losing the ability to revert to old versions of the project. Only do this for old, no longer needed checkpoints.

#### 🟢 LLM Models
*   **What is it?**: "Brain" files (e.g., Gemma, Llama). They are very large (often several dozen GB).
*   **Can I delete it?**: If you delete a model, Venom will download it again the next time it starts (which may take time and consume data).

#### 🟡 Build / Cache (e.g., `web-next/.next`)
*   **What is it?**: Temporary files generated by the application to make it run faster.
*   **Can I delete it?**: **YES**. The system will rebuild them automatically if needed. Safe to clean in case of an emergency.

### Space Management
If the disk usage indicator glows red:
1.  Check **Data: dreaming (timelines)** – they usually grow the fastest.
2.  Clear old caches (e.g., `.next`).
3.  Review your **User Timelines** and delete very old experiments.

## 3. Performance Profiles (Runtime)

In the configuration panel, you can also switch Venom's operation modes (Profiles):

*   **⚡ Full Stack**: Starts everything (AI, Backend, UI, Databases). For normal, full work.
*   **🍃 Light**: Starts only Backend and UI. Saves battery/resources when you don't need AI code generation (e.g., just browsing files).
*   **🛑 LLM OFF**: Completely disables language models. Useful on weaker machines or when you want to work manually.

---

## 4. Hardware Recommendations

Choosing the right AI engine (Runtime) is crucial for system stability, especially on weaker hardware.

### 🐢 Ollama (Recommended for "Low-Spec")
If your computer has:
*   Less than 16GB RAM.
*   A weak graphics card (below 8GB VRAM) or integrated graphics.
*   Stability issues with vLLM (OOM errors, crashes).

**RECOMMENDATION: Choose OLLAMA.**
It is an engine optimized for low resource consumption. It runs slightly slower but is much more stable and uses less VRAM/RAM than vLLM. Ideal for working on laptops and older workstations.

### 🚀 vLLM (Recommended for "High-Performance")
If you have:
*   A powerful NVIDIA graphics card (e.g., RTX 3090/4090, A100).
*   A large amount of VRAM (>12GB).

**RECOMMENDATION: Choose vLLM.**
It offers unbeatable speed (tokens per second) but is very demanding ("greedy") on memory. On weaker configurations, it may cause system instability.

## 5. Configuration Panel: System Parameters

In addition to managing disk costs and services, the `Parameters` tab in `/config` allows you to control agent behavior.

*   **AI Mode**: Decides whether Venom works fully locally ("Local") or hybrid ("Hybrid" - e.g., heavy tasks in the cloud). Default: **Local**.
*   **Hive (Distributed Processing)**: Enables/disables the distributed architecture (Queue Worker).
*   **Shadow (Desktop Awareness)**: If enabled, a background agent monitors system events, trying to proactively detect problems.
*   **Ghost (GUI Automation)**: Allows Venom to control the mouse and keyboard (RPA). **Disabled by default** for security reasons.

> [!TIP]
> Changing parameters (e.g., disabling Shadow) may require a system restart to free up resources.

## 6. Troubleshooting

Typical situations you may encounter as an Operator:

### 🔴 System not responding ("Connection Refused")
*   **Cause**: The docker container (`venom-backend`) is not running or is restarting.
*   **Solution**: Check the logs in the terminal. Make sure Docker Desktop is running. As a last resort, execute `docker-compose restart`.

### 🟡 Model "grinds" indefinitely (Timeout)
*   **Cause**: The selected model is too large for your graphics card (vLLM OOM) or too slow (CPU).
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Switch Runtime to **Ollama** in `/config`.
    2.  Choose a smaller model (e.g., `gemma:2b` or `llama3:8b-quantized`).

### 🟠 Out of disk space
*   **Cause**: Accumulation of Dreams (Dream Timelines) or model caches.
*   **Solution**: Go to `/config` -> Services -> Storage and clear the **Dreams** and **Cache** sections.

### ⚪ Interface is in English, although I want Polish
*   **Cause**: Browser settings or no saved choice.
*   **Solution**: Click the flag/language icon in the Sidebar and select "PL". The setting will be remembered.
