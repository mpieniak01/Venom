## How to report bugs or request features

- Check if a similar issue already exists.
- If not — open a new issue, providing:
  - reproduction steps description (if it's a bug),
  - Python version and system,
  - optionally stack trace / logs,
  - expected result vs. actual result.

---

## How to contribute code

1. Fork the repo → create a `feat/`, `fix/`, or `chore/` branch.
2. Make changes, run `make lint && make test` (or locally `pre-commit run --all-files && pytest`).
3. Add tests / documentation if you're changing API / logic.
4. Use standard commit messages (see below).
5. Create PR — if everything passes, we'll merge to `main`.

## Code style and commit messages

- Python code: **PEP-8 / Black + Ruff + isort**.
- Before committing, run `pre-commit install`.
- Commit message:
  - format: `type(scope): short description` (e.g., `feat(core): add orchestrator`)
  - types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`.
  - first line ≤ 50 characters, then blank line, then details.

---

## Tests and CI

- All newly added functionality must have tests (pytest).
- Tests go into the `/tests` directory.
- CI Lite on PR checks fast quality gates first (lint + selected unit tests).
- SonarCloud is a required PR gate (bugs, vulnerabilities, code smells, maintainability, duplication).
- Snyk scans are run periodically to catch newly disclosed dependency/container CVEs.

### Quality checklist before PR

- Run `pre-commit run --all-files`.
- Run `mypy venom_core`.
- Keep functions simple (avoid high cognitive complexity and large conditional blocks).
- Remove dead code, unused imports, and placeholder blocks.
- Treat `ruff`, `mypy`, and Sonar findings as blockers for new changes.

We don't tolerate: hate, insults, harassment, spamming.
