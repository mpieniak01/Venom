# Venom Operator Manual

Welcome to the Operator Manual. This document is designed to explain how to use the Venom system on a daily basis, understand the displayed metrics, and manage its resources. Unlike the technical documentation, we focus here on *usability*, not *implementation*.

## 1. Key Concepts

To effectively collaborate with Venom, it is worth understanding two foundations of its operation: **Timelines** and **Dreams**.

### ⏳ Timelines
Think of Timelines as **save points in a game** or **alternative versions of reality**.

*   **What is it for?** Venom allows you to experiment safely. Before you introduce risky changes to the code, the system (or you manually) creates a "snapshot" of the current state.
*   **How does it work for you?** If an experiment fails, you can immediately revert to the starting point without losing a working system.
*   **User/Core Timelines**: These are your "main" saves – backups before refactoring, project checkpoints. They are valuable and you usually want to keep them.

### 🌙 Dreams
Dreams are Venom's process of **self-improvement** during free time.

*   **What is it?** When you are not using the system (or at night), Venom analyzes its knowledge base and comes up with hypothetical programming problems, and then tries to solve them.
*   **What for?** Every solved "dream" becomes a new skill (lesson) that Venom can use in the future, helping you.
*   **Dream Timelines**: Each dream takes place in an isolated timeline so as not to clutter your main project. These data can take up a lot of space but are fully reproducible (can be safely deleted).

## 2. Configuration Panel: Disk Costs

In the `/config` section, you will find the **"Disk Costs"** panel. It is used to monitor the health of your work environment.

### How to read the metrics?

The panel divides data into several categories. Here are the most important ones you might ask about:

#### 🟣 Dane: dreaming (timelines)
*   **What is it?**: Space occupied on the disk by **Dreams** (historical training simulations).
*   **Can I delete this?**: **YES**. These are "historical" data. Deleting them will not break the project; you will only lose the ability to preview "how Venom solved that specific dream" (but the knowledge/lesson extracted from it is already saved in memory and will remain safe).
*   **Recommendation**: If you are running out of disk space, this is the first candidate for cleaning.

#### 🔵 Dane: timelines (user/core)
*   **What is it?**: Space occupied by **YOUR** restore points and project backups.
*   **Can I delete this?**: **CAREFULLY**. Deleting these data means losing the ability to revert to old versions of the project. Do this only for old, no longer needed checkpoints.

#### 🟢 Modele LLM (LLM Models)
*   **What is it?**: "Brain" files (e.g., Gemma, Llama). They are very large (often tens of GB).
*   **Can I delete this?**: If you delete a model, Venom will download it again at the next startup (which may take time and consume transfer).

#### 🟡 Build / Cache (e.g., `web-next/.next`)
*   **What is it?**: Temporary files generated by the application to make it run faster.
*   **Can I delete this?**: **YES**. The system will rebuild them automatically if needed. Safe to clean in case of failure.

### Space Management
If the disk usage indicator lights up red:
1.  Check **Dane: dreaming (timelines)** – usually they grow the fastest.
2.  Clear old cache (e.g., `.next`).
3.  Review your **User Timelines** and delete very old experiments.

## 3. Performance Profiles (Runtime)

In the configuration panel, you can also switch Venom's work modes (Profiles):

*   **⚡ Full Stack**: Runs everything (AI, Backend, UI, Databases). For normal, full work.
*   **🍃 Light**: Runs only Backend and UI. Saves battery/resources when you don't need code generation by AI (e.g., just browsing files).
*   **🛑 LLM OFF**: Completely disables language models. Useful on weaker machines or when you want to work manually.

*This document will be developed along with new system features.*
