# Venom Operator Manual

Welcome to the Operator Manual. This document is designed to explain how to use the Venom system on a daily basis, understand the displayed metrics, and manage its resources. Unlike the technical documentation, we focus here on *usability*, not *implementation*.

## 1. Key Concepts

To effectively collaborate with Venom, it is worth understanding two foundations of its operation: **Timelines** and **Dreams**.

### ⏳ Timelines
Think of Timelines as **save points in a game** or **alternative versions of reality**.

*   **What is it for?** Venom allows you to experiment safely. Before you introduce risky changes to the code, the system (or you manually) creates a "snapshot" of the current state.
*   **How does it work for you?** If an experiment fails, you can immediately revert to the starting point without losing a working system.
*   **User/Core Timelines**: These are your "main" saves – backups before refactoring, project checkpoints. They are valuable and you usually want to keep them.
*   **Usage Example**: You plan a large refactor of the navigation. You create a Timeline named "pre-nav-refactor". If halfway through the work the code stops compiling, you restore the "pre-nav-refactor" state with one click.

### 🌙 Dreams
Dreams are Venom's process of **self-improvement** during free time.

*   **What is it?** When you are not using the system (or at night), Venom analyzes its knowledge base and comes up with hypothetical programming problems, and then tries to solve them.
*   **What for?** Every solved "dream" becomes a new skill (lesson) that Venom can use in the future, helping you.
*   **Dream Timelines**: Each dream takes place in an isolated timeline so as not to clutter your main project. These data can take up a lot of space but are fully reproducible (can be safely deleted).
*   **Example**: Venom noticed you struggled with Nginx configuration yesterday. At night, it "dreamt" up a scenario to fix the `nginx.conf` file, tested it in isolation, and now "knows" how to do it correctly when you ask about it tomorrow.

## 2. Configuration Panel: Disk Costs

In the `/config` section, you will find the **"Disk Costs"** panel. It is used to monitor the health of your work environment.

### How to read the metrics?

The panel divides data into several categories. Here are the most important ones you might ask about:

#### 🟣 Data: dreaming (timelines)
*   **What is it?**: Space occupied on the disk by **Dreams** (historical training simulations).
*   **Can I delete this?**: **YES**. These are "historical" data. Deleting them will not break the project; you will only lose the ability to preview "how Venom solved that specific dream" (but the knowledge/lesson extracted from it is already saved in memory and will remain safe).
*   **Recommendation**: If you are running out of disk space, this is the first candidate for cleaning.

#### 🔵 Data: timelines (user/core)
*   **What is it?**: Space occupied by **YOUR** restore points and project backups.
*   **Can I delete this?**: **CAREFULLY**. Deleting these data means losing the ability to revert to old versions of the project. Do this only for old, no longer needed checkpoints.

#### 🟢 LLM Models
*   **What is it?**: "Brain" files (e.g., Gemma, Llama). They are very large (often tens of GB).
*   **Can I delete this?**: If you delete a model, Venom will download it again at the next startup (which may take time and consume transfer).

#### 🟡 Build / Cache (e.g., `web-next/.next`)
*   **What is it?**: Temporary files generated by the application to make it run faster.
*   **Can I delete this?**: **YES**. The system will rebuild them automatically if needed. Safe to clean in case of failure.

### Space Management
If the disk usage indicator lights up red:
1.  Check **Data: dreaming (timelines)** – usually they grow the fastest.
2.  Clear old cache (e.g., `.next`).
3.  Review your **User Timelines** and delete very old experiments.

## 3. Performance Profiles (Runtime)

In the configuration panel, you can also switch Venom's work modes (Profiles):

*   **⚡ Full Stack**: Runs everything (AI, Backend, UI, Databases). For normal, full work.
*   **🍃 Light**: Runs only Backend and UI. Saves battery/resources when you don't need code generation by AI (e.g., just browsing files).
*   **🛑 LLM OFF**: Completely disables language models. Useful on weaker machines or when you want to work manually.

---

## 4. Hardware Recommendations

Choosing the right AI Engine (Runtime) is crucial for system stability, especially on weaker hardware.

### 🐢 Ollama (Recommended for "Low-Spec")
If your computer has:
*   Less than 16GB RAM.
*   Weak graphics card (below 8GB VRAM) or integrated graphics.
*   Stability issues with vLLM (OOM errors, crashes).

**RECOMMENDATION: Choose OLLAMA.**
It is an engine optimized for low resource usage. It works slightly slower but is much more stable and consumes less VRAM/RAM than vLLM. Ideal for laptops and older workstations.

### 🚀 vLLM (Recommended for "High-Performance")
If you have:
*   Powerful NVIDIA graphics card (e.g., RTX 3090/4090, A100).
*   Large amount of VRAM (>12GB).

**RECOMMENDATION: Choose vLLM.**
It offers unrivaled speed (tokens per second) but is very memory-demanding ("greedy"). On weaker configurations, it may cause system instability.

## 5. Configuration Panel: System Parameters

In addition to managing disk costs and services, the `Parameters` tab in `/config` allows you to control the behavior of agents.

*   **AI Mode**: Decides whether Venom runs fully locally ("Local") or hybrid ("Hybrid" - e.g., heavy tasks in cloud). Default: **Local**.
*   **Hive (Distributed Processing)**: Enables/disables distributed architecture (Queue Worker).
*   **Shadow (Desktop Awareness)**: If enabled, a background agent monitors system events, trying to proactively detect problems.
*   **Ghost (GUI Automation)**: Allows Venom to control mouse and keyboard (RPA). **Disabled by default** for security reasons.

> [!TIP]
> Changing parameters (e.g., disabling Shadow) may require a restart to release resources.

## 6. Troubleshooting

Typical situations you might encounter as an Operator:

### 🔴 System not responding ("Connection Refused")
*   **Cause**: Docker container (`venom-backend`) is not running or is restarting.
*   **Solution**: Check logs in terminal. Ensure Docker Desktop is running. As a last resort, run `docker-compose restart`.

### 🟡 Model spins indefinitely (Timeout)
*   **Cause**: Selected model is too large for your GPU (vLLM OOM) or too slow (CPU).
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Switch Runtime to **Ollama** in `/config`.
    2.  Choose a smaller model (e.g., `gemma:2b` or `llama3:8b-quantized`).

### 🟠 No disk space
*   **Cause**: Accumulation of "Dreams" (Dream Timelines) or model cache.
*   **Solution**: Go to `/config` -> Services -> Storage and clear **Dreams** and **Cache** sections.

### ⚪ Interface is in English, even though I want Polish
*   **Cause**: Browser settings or no saved choice.
*   **Solution**: Click the flag/language icon in the Sidebar and select "PL". The setting will be remembered.
